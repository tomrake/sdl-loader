Welcome,

This site is an experiment to define and use standard locations of the sdl 1.2 libraries for  use in Common Lisp games.

When I started experimenting years ago I just downloaded some sdl .dll from some site.
Today I want to a definite version of  sdl and document the process.

I am revising this site I used this website to document my progress in a step by step manner but after reading this site, I can't follow my notes. So I am organing again.
